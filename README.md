## Introduction

This is the Git repository for the Node.js MySQL Microservice module for the **Oracle Public Cloud DevOps Cloud Native Microservices-DB Workshop.** There are no dependencies for this Node.js module.  However, a standard MySQL subdirectory is included in this code.  The main js file for this Node.js module is server.js.  This module performs three very simple functions:
- First server.js calls the MySQL database and selects data on products and categories.
- Secondly the server.js code then formats this result set into JSON.
- Lastly server.js writes this JSON to the web.
